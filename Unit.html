                    Tortuga Gaming is a Clan that was funded in circa. 2018 and went through various renaming and emblem changes since then.<br>
                    Today its known for its turtle shaped insignia, which looks neutral yet challenging to the people seeing it.<br>
                    The clan is not known well for being very good to civilians in Arma but certainly consist of nice people. to the people seeing it. The clan is not known well for being very good to civilians in Arma but certainly consist of nice people.<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Its not a very serious clan whose actions luckily do not influence the state of the real world.<br>
                    It mostly plays the Liberation game mode casually messing around, earning it the name “Special guerrilla unit” what actually stands for “Special guerrilla tactics and special people”.<br>
                    Influences the outcome of many games with wacky ideas instead of applying well known but boring tactics that have proven to be efficient.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The clan respects the laws of war but will not always apply them in Arma as of missing seriousness of it without real life consequences.<br>
                    Just for the sake of having said it, we as well as many others support the International Committee of the Red Cross and some of us bought the "Laws of war" DLC to help funding it.<br>
                    (Warecrimes are not punished in this clan)<br>
                    (Sorry International Committee of the Red Cross)
